A number of errors were found in the formatting of the sample test cases.
In numerous cases, the double-space between the SOUTH pits and the NORTH
kalah was inadvertently single spaced. In one case, the calculation was
slightly incorrect. You will find a list of all changes made below.

[also note the change of SOUTH's pit 6 as well]

5/* was added to capture the case in which the final wrap-around stone
falls into own of the moving player's empty pits, in which case a
Go-Again Move is not to be performed. (This test case is a minor
modification of test case 2.)
