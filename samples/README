To run this test suite, make a flag or set the default behavior of your
program to be to accept a file, accept a move on stdin, and then exit
immediately saving a file. Alternately, manually load the file given
as input.txt, make the move using the user interface in whatever manner
you want and then place the file that is output in the outputs folder
as the appropriate number followed by '.output'. Enjoy and forward any
questions or concerns to aeg37@drexel.edu.
