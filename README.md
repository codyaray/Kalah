This is a playable (command-line) game of Kalah written in Ruby using RSpec and Cucumber. You can play against the computer or you can pit different AIs against one another.

This project provides a simple game engine for playing two-player turn-based zero-sum games and includes AI players using the minimax algorithm and alpha-beta pruning. Eventually, I'd like to extract out the engine from the Kalah game itself and write a few more simple games on top of it (namely, tictactoe and othello).
